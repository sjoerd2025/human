// EvalSymlinks fails on a path that does not exist yet — a project whose
// container has never run. Keeping the absolute form there is not enough: on
// darwin $TMPDIR (/var/folders/…) resolves to /private/var/folders/…, so an
// existing root canonicalises to the /private form while the missing one stays
// /var — the same directory under two names. dedupeRoots compares strings, so
// a nested root in the unresolved form survived deduplication and its tree was
// walked twice. The nearest existing ancestor is therefore resolved and the
// missing tail rejoined: the tail cannot contain symlinks (it does not exist),
// so the rejoined form is canonical for comparison, and the resulting root is
// either walkable or missing — the same contract as before.
