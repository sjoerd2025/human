# Desktop (Wails) targets. The desktop app is a cgo backend (webkit2gtk on
# Linux, WebView2 on Windows, Obj-C on macOS) and CANNOT be cross-compiled — it
# is built on its native runner only (see .github/workflows/desktop.yml). All
# desktop Go files are behind the `wailsapp` build tag so the default `build`,
# `test`, `lint` and `check` targets never touch this cgo path and stay green on
# a plain toolchain. The tag is NOT `desktop`: Wails reserves that name and
# strips it before binding generation, which would hide every file. Building
# requires the Wails CLI (desktop-deps installs it).
desktop-deps:
	go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@v2.13.0

# Wails v2 defaults to the EOL webkit2gtk-4.0 ABI on Linux; modern Debian/Ubuntu
# ship only webkit2gtk-4.1, which requires the `webkit2_41` tag. Auto-append it
# when 4.0 is absent but 4.1 is present so the build works out of the box; macOS
# and Windows are untouched. Override the whole set with `make desktop DESKTOP_TAGS=...`.

# the frontend build (tsc + bundle) and compiles the cgo backend; Wails adds its
# own `desktop` output tag, and `-tags wailsapp` makes our gated files visible to
# both the binding-generation pass and the final compile. A plain
# `go build ./desktop/` links but panics at startup, so it is never the build
# path (see docs/desktop-app.md).

# CI runs, so drift is visible before a push instead of only after one.

# compile time — so a stale copy ships silently frozen artifacts exactly
# like the board's dist/ does (SC-3613). web-dist-check is the pnpm-side
# guard: rebuild, recopy, and diff against git so drift is visible before a
